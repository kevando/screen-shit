# Screenshit


Harness the power of your clipboard by using screenshit to copy the screen shot image to the clipboard. Then you can simply `ctrl` + `v` to paste the image into Messages, Slack, whatever you want.

### Motivation

I made this app because I take lots of screenshots and want a better way to manage it. ScreenShit runs in the background and monitors for new screen shots. When a new screen shot is detected, ScreenShit prompts you with options for handling the screen shot.  I understand apple includes a features like this in the new osx. I've yet to upgrade my OS.

I also wanted to bring back some classic UI parts from early internet. Sunglasses emoji pays homage to minesweeper and the paper clip is a nod to Clippy  - jar jar binks of the Windows.
