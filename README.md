### History

[`1.0.3`](https://github.com/kevando/screenshit/releases/tag/v1.0.2) - Mostly for hoffman. Hoping he gives good feedback.  
[`1.0.2`](https://github.com/kevando/screenshit/releases/tag/v1.0.2)   
[`1.0.1`](https://github.com/kevando/screenshit/releases/tag/v1.0.1)    
[`1.0.0`](https://github.com/kevando/screenshit/releases/tag/v1.0.1)   



### Why?

> I made this app because I take lots of screenshots and want a better way to manage it. ScreenShit runs in the background and monitors for new screen shots. When a new screen shot is detected, ScreenShit prompts you with options for handling the screen shot.  I understand apple includes a features like this in the new osx. I've yet to upgrade my OS.
