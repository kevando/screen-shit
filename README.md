### Building

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer in order to build this app.

```

### Distributing

)

```bash
yarn package-mac
```




## Motivation

> I made this app because I take lots of screenshots and want a better way to manage it. ScreenShit runs in the background and monitors for new screen shots. When a new screen shot is detected, ScreenShit prompts you with options for handling the screen shot.  I understand apple includes a features like this in the new osx. I've yet to upgrade my OS.
