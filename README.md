Assistance when you need it.

## What?

ScreenShit is a desktop application that runs in the background and monitors for new screen shots. When a new screen shot is detected, ScreenShit prompts you with options for handling the screen shot.


## Open Source

I made this app using Electron, so you can run this locally if you want.


### Local Development



```
git clone [...]
npm install
electron-forge start  
```
