## User Guide

### Take screen shot

The application uses the default screen capture utility that comes with OSX so can continue taking screen shots the same way.

- Press <kbd>CMD âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT â‡§</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> to take a full-screen screenshot

- Press <kbd>CMD âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT â‡§</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> to take a rectangular selection of the screen

- Press <kbd>CMD âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT â‡§</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> + <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to capture a specific window or menu

### Copy & paste
This can happen automatically or  you can choose to get prompted. Most modern web applications let you past image right into the form or textarea.

### Motivation

I take lots of screenshots. After my billionth screen shot, I noticed a pattern. It would be super helpful if I could copy the image to clipboard.

I also wanted to bring back some classic UI parts from early internet. Sunglasses emoji pays homage to minesweeper and the paper clip is a nod to [Clippy](https://twitter.com/kevando_/status/1089357604176838656)  - jar jar binks of the Windows.
