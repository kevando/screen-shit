### Do More With Screen Shots

![Logo](app/icon/96x96.png)


**Screen Shit** is a simple, yet powerful, desktop application designed to make you more efficient with your screen shots. 

## How to install

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/kevando/screenshit/releases/download/v1.0.1/screen-shit-darwin-x64-1.0.0.zip)
2. Unzip it (it's safe)

## How to use

1. Click start
2. Take screen shot (CMD + SHIFT + 4)
3. Copy image to clipboard
4. Paste (CMD + V) image into apps like iMessage



## Why?

I made this app because I take lots of screenshots and want a better way to manage it. ScreenShit runs in the background and monitors for new screen shots. When a new screen shot is detected, ScreenShit prompts you with options for handling the screen shot.  I understand apple includes a features like this in the new osx. I've yet to upgrade my OS.
